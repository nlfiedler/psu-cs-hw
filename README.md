# Penn State CS Homework

My old college projects/homework for computer science courses at PSU.

For students of an algorithms course, the code in the `graph` directory
demonstrates how various graph algorithms work, using a visual graphing tool.
You can create vertices and edges, then perform operations such as Kruskal's
MST, Shortest Path, or DFS. Written for a software engineering course at PSU.
